# Tutorial for the Indonesia-APCTP Workshop on Quantum Computing and Simulation 2023

# Overview
This tutorial will teach you how to create a quantum circuit, firstly to do entanglement computation using qiskit. Also, this tutorial will guide you how to connect to [IBM Quantum Computing](https://quantum.ibm.com/) platform. Additionally, this tutorial will teach you to perform quantum chemistry calculations using [pennylane-qchem](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/qml_qchem.html), which is a quantum software development kit from Xanadu Corporation. 

# Installation
Before we do the first calculation, please install one of the platforms below to install jupyter notebook or jupyterlab. 

Follow these instructions: 
1. Download Anaconda from <https://www.anaconda.com/download> 
2. Download Miniconda from <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html> and install the required packages
3. Download Visual Studio Code from <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>, then install Jupyter using the Extensions tab.


After that install 

```
pip install jupyterlab numpy matplotlib
```

If you have Linux OS (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.), you can simplify the installation process by following this platform installation guide.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python-pip
pip install notebook matplotlib
```
